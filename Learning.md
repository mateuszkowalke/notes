### Constrained to 3 subjects at a time
Need to keep one subject to be possible to learn without using computer (book, phone + notebook)

#### List of current topics:
- [[C Programming Language]] on [[Raspberry Pi Pico]] -> lora telemetry
- design patterns book
- [[Rust]] vs go (try out rust by implementing http server with tokio)

#### List of future subjects:
- rust -> build LORA telemetry with the newer modules
- math (derivatives on brilliant -> mathematics for machine learning)
- CS lectures (mathematics for CS -> algorithms -> architecture)
- pi zero camera with egg recognizing
- once rust vs go is settled -> implement document generation for falcons (serde for docx)
- voice to text for notetaking
- relearn python using katas and kaggle
- linux (basic knowledge, kernel by creating drivers)
- SQL

#### List of programming languages to know:
- TS/JS
- C/C++/ASM
- Rust
- Python
