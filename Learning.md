# Learning

### List of current topics:

  - maths on brilliant
  - raytracing in a weekend -> raytracing course from SimonDev
  - voice recognition app for speech learning,

### Constrained to 3 subjects at a time

Need to keep one subject to be possible to learn without using computer (book, phone + notebook). For notes use notebook when obsidian is not available. Need to keep one subject from each section active.

Try the top to bottom approach to learning first. If there are any obstacles  - read underlying technology docs thoroughly.

### 3 main categories

##### Maths

This category contains everything related to math problems  - from derivatives to linear algebra. Kaggle competitions also fall into this category.

Topics:
 - maths on brilliant,
 - book "Mathematics for machine learning".

##### CS

This category represents everything related to computer science problems. It includes for example electronics, algorithms and data structures, low level programming, type theory, OS -es etc.

Topics:
 - CS lectures from youtube,
 - ARM and x86 assembly,
 - electronics course from forbot,
 - rp pico,
 - algorithms and data structures with c on leetcode,
 - codewars,
 - linux on hack the box,
 - SQL (postgreSQL and SQLite),
 - operating system https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html
 - course from SimonDev

##### Practical Projects

These involve real world applications. Things to remember are to always use most appropriate technologies.

Topics:
 - voice recognition app for speech learning,
 - algorithm visualisations (using wasm and threejs),
 - falcon manager site,
 - cameras with egg recognition and live streaming,
 - lora telemetry.

#### List of programming languages to know:

 - [[TypeScript]]
 - [[C Programming Language]]/C++/ASM
 - [[Go]]
 - [[Rust]]
 - [[Python]]
