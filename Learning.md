# Learning

## List of current topics:
- math on brilliant
- design patterns book
- document generation for falcons -> use js library and dotx - finalize falcon manager project

### 3 main categories

##### Maths

This category contains everything related to math problems - from derivatives to linear algebra. Kaggle competitions also fall into this category.

Topics:
- maths from brilliant,
- book "Mathematics for machine learning".

##### CS

This category represents everything related to computer science problems. It includes for example electronics, algorithms and data structures, low level programming, type theory, OS-es etc.

Topics:
- CS lectures from youtube,
- ARM and x86 assembly,
- electronics course from forbot,
- rp pico,
- algorithms and data structures with rust on codewars,
- linux on hack the box,
- SQL (postgreSQL and SQLite),
- configure arch linux + xmonad(learn some haskell).

##### Practical Projects

These involve real world applications. Things to remember are to always use most appropriate technologies.

Topics:
- falcon manager site (svelte + nestjs + postgres),
- cameras with egg recognition and live streaming,
- lora telemetry.

### Constrained to 3 subjects at a time

Need to keep one subject to be possible to learn without using computer (book, phone + notebook). For notes use notebook when obsidian is not available. Need to keep one subject from each section active.

Try the top to bottom approach to learning first. If there are any obstacles - read underlying technology docs thoroughly.

#### List of programming languages to know:
- [[TypeScript]]
- [[C Programming Language]]/C++/ASM
- [[Rust]]
- [[Python]]
